This is a quick guide to explain the different files (in-case you get stuck)parts used and final thoughts for the project. 
For advice on wiring please see thoughts and help at the bottom of here.

The files

FCStd
These are raw designs for the case's and allow you to alter the placement and size to fit your needs.
I used FreeCAD and you can download it from their site.

stl
These can be used by most 3D printer slicers and allow you to take the cases and alter how strong or quick you'd like them to be printed.
I used Cura a free to download slicer.

ino
These are sketches or code for the Arduino and also work with the chips we used.
You will need to download the IDE from their website and upload the code by USB.
I used this as it's what I know but you may use anything.

Parts

Everyone is going to build the Recce differently so have left out resistors & capacitors - it all depends on how you set up your power supply, switches found and motors used.
Part prices & availability have gone weird at the moment but at the start of this project it would cost ~ £20 - £26. 

Chips

atmega328
ATtiny 85 or equivalent
Arduino Nano or any mini
There are other chips you may use but these are my gotofor light code. 

Power supply

3.7v Lithium Polymer Battery
TP4056 Module Battery Charger
MT3608 2A DC-DC Voltage Step Up
If you build your own PCB most 3.3v & 5v regulator 

Sensors

HCSR04 Sensor Ultrasonic

Transistors

PN2222A or TIP120 tho double check with the motor and PSU you're using

Thoughts and help

As brought up in parts everyone is going to build this differently. I have made a rough wire guide for the ATtiny85 that should help you figure out how everything is put together
you just need to adapt it to suit your board or chip.

The code supplied will give you a starting point to test that it's working without the motors burning out or always spinning. You need to alter them as you go to suit the distance
you want the motors to go off.

If you're struggling and would like help please feel free to send a message. alternatively have a look online for your local maker space - these are groups of people who enjoy building and might be able to help you for a donation or case of beer :) 

Wanted to give some freedoms to developers as hardware is a nightmare so remember to play nice. More then happy to keep my end free & open for people starting.
